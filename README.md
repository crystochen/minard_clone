# Project 2: Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign of 1812

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
This project reproduces the famous data visualization project, [Charles Minard's Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard#:~:text=Charles%20Minard's%20map%20of%20Napoleon,location%20relative%20to%20specific%20dates.).
Charles Minard's 1869 chart shows the number of troops in Napoleonâ€™s 1812 Russian campaign army, their movements, as well as the temperature they encountered on the return path. 

It establishes the database using `pandas` and `sqlite3`, utilizes `matplotlib` and `basemap` for proof-of-concept, and the final visualization.

## âœ¨ Project Highlights

1. We utilized unstructured text data sourced from ["The Grammar of Graphics"](https://info5940.infosci.cornell.edu/notes/dataviz/grammar-of-graphics/) website.
2. We then consolidated three separate datasets from this raw data, despite their inconsistent row and column numbers.
3. Finally, we presented these datasets on a geospatial visualization, which helped translate their complex structure into a clear and understandable visual. 

## ðŸ“– Reproduction Guide
- Install [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)

- Set up your environment based on `environment.yml` using the command: `conda env creat -f environment.yml`

- Save the `minard.txt` in `data/` folder Run python `creat_minard_db.ipynb` under the environment to create `minard.db` in the `data/` folder

- Run python `plot_with-basemap.ipynb` under the environment to generate the final visualization `minard_clone.png`.
